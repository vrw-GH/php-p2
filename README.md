# my php project #2 - files

<br>Deployed to: <a href="https://php2-files.herokuapp.com/">p2-files.herokuapp.com</a>

The git "README.md" file (this) is sanitized and directly read into the site page's "description" <div..> inside <pre..> tags.

This is a project to explore file activities such as uploads/listing/downloads etc.
<br>
** File upload only works (for the moment) on localhost. **
